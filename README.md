Happy Holi
This project creates an interactive fluid simulation to celebrate the festival of colors, Holi. It utilizes HTML and CSS for structure and styling, along with JavaScript for implementing the fluid simulation using WebGL.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (WebGL)


Overview
This project simulates the spreading of colors on a canvas, allowing users to interact by clicking or touching the canvas to splatter colors. The colors spread and blend realistically, creating a visually engaging experience reminiscent of playing with colors during Holi.

Features
Real-time fluid simulation
Interactive color splattering by clicking or touching the canvas
Fluid dynamics including density, velocity, pressure, and curl
Color blending and spreading effects

How to Use
Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser that supports WebGL.
Click or touch the canvas to splatter colors.
Enjoy the dynamic fluid simulation as colors spread and blend.

Note
For the best experience, use a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
Experiment with different interaction techniques to observe the fluid simulation's behavior.
